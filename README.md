# Minesweeper
Minesweeper project I made in high school. Works most of the time ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

RNG mechanic is slightly broken, causing some boards to generate with many mines in the bottom right corner. An easy fix, but I'd rather keep this as a time capsule of sorts.

New Skills during Project: Java Swing, Recursive Logic, and ActionEvents and their complementary handlers
