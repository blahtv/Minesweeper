# Minesweeper
Minesweeper project I made in high school for AP Computer Science Principles

RNG mechanic is slightly broken, causing some boards to generate with many mines in the bottom right corner. An easy fix, but I'd rather keep this as a time capsule of sorts to compare future projects to.

New Skills during Project: Java Swing, Recursive Logic, and ActionEvents and their complementary handlers
